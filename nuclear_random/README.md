# NUCLEAR RANDOM NUMBERS DEMO
The code in @main.asm is a program written in assembly language for the Commodore 64 computer. Its purpose is to generate truly random bytes using the decay events of a radioactive isotope as a source of entropy.

The program does not take any direct input from the user. Instead, it relies on the decay events of a radioactive isotope, which are detected by a Geiger counter connected to the Commodore 64's joystick port. When a decay event occurs, it triggers a pulse that simulates a button press on the joystick.

The output of the program is an array of 255 random bytes, stored in memory starting at address $2000 (8192 decimal). These random bytes are generated by sampling the least significant bit (LSB) of a free-running timer (Timer B) whenever a decay event is detected.

Here's how the program achieves its purpose:

The program sets up Timer B to count CPU clock cycles and starts it running.
It then enters a loop where it waits for a decay event to occur, which is detected by checking for a simulated button press on the joystick port.
When a decay event is detected, the program reads the LSB of Timer B and shifts it into a temporary byte.
After 8 bits have been shifted into the temporary byte, it is stored in the random_bytes array, and the process starts over for the next byte.
This process is repeated until all 255 bytes in the random_bytes array have been filled.
The key logic flow and data transformation happening in the program are:

The program continuously monitors the joystick port for a simulated button press, which indicates a decay event.
When a decay event is detected, the LSB of Timer B is read and shifted into a temporary byte.
After 8 bits have been shifted into the temporary byte, it is stored in the random_bytes array, and the process starts over for the next byte.
This process is repeated until all 255 bytes in the random_bytes array have been filled.
The program uses a free-running timer (Timer B) to avoid relying on system entropy, which could potentially be predictable or influenced by external factors. By sampling the timer's value at the precise moment of a decay event, which is a truly random quantum event, the program ensures that the generated bytes are truly random and unpredictable.
