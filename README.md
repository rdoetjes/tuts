# Tutorial collection

In the underlying directories, you will find software I have written for training videos and other tutorials.
Many of these videos are on https://www.youtube.com/channel/CallousCoder 

Many different languages are covered, ranging from MUMPS (M) to modern day languages like Zig (which I adore) and Rust.
All these tutorials are based around small (private) projects, that I either created purposely for videos or have been created for small private projects.
