**Zig HTTP Client Example**
We are using the `std.http` module to make an HTTP request to the OpenAI API to generate a joke bout Germans.

We are using Zig 0.14.0 here, a lot as changed since the last version and probably will change again in the future. As it seems the interfaces are not stable yet.
